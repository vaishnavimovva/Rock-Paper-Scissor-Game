# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
In this project we develop a classic rock paper scissors game using tkinter and python
Rock paper scissor is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of the three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are “rock,” “paper,” and “scissors.” Here in this project the players are the user and the computer. The user gets to play against the computer. The computer gives a random choice out of the three choices rock-paper and scissors while the user gets to pick a choice of their own. The system keeps the score throughout the game and allows the user to exit the game whenever they like.
I have created a basic rock-paper-scissors game that will help beginners who are just delving into Python Programming think logically and practice their concepts while having fun! 

I further extended the project with GUI by using tkinter. This helps in enhancing the game by making it more user friendly and interesting to play.
